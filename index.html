            <p>Once upon a time, a certain person was interested in the creative areas of life. He wasn't a good drawer, but his imagination and creativity in everything he did were exceptional. Even when cooking, he couldn't avoid using food in a creative way, making it look beautiful at first sight. He was also interested in science but couldn't initially match the two interests until he realized the advantages of the times he was living in. The Creator had deposited such potential in him that even 30 years after he was born, he was still discovering his true potential. He wanted to create. He understood that the world was made from a code—a living code like DNA. Although these codes were beyond his comprehension, he started learning about current science and, with guidance from experienced close friends, he now had a goal. He wanted to become a Full Stack developer, but not an ordinary one; he wanted to develop the Websites of the future. If it exists in the imagination, it can be created.</p>
